# Nike Clone Project

This project is a clone of the official Nike website, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap**. The purpose of this project is to practice front-end web development skills by replicating the Nike website's design and functionality. 

### Features
- **Header & Footer as Components**: Both header and footer are modularized and imported as separate components into the main JavaScript file using ES6 **modules**.
- **Scroll-based Header Styling**: The header changes its style dynamically based on scroll position.
- **Search Functionality**: The project includes a fully functional search feature that opens an overlay form. The products are filtered by the search term entered by the user.
- **Pagination**: Products are displayed across multiple pages with **pagination** to navigate between pages.
- **Product Detail Page**: Clicking on a product redirects the user to a detailed page with more information about the selected product.

### Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Basic structure and content of the site.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the website.
- **JavaScript**: Implemented functionality for the search feature, product filtering, pagination, and dynamic styling.
